    # 3) to select an alternative config file
    #    by setting DNSMASQ_OPTS to --conf-file=<file>
    # 4) to tell dnsmasq to read the files in /etc/dnsmasq.d for
    #    more configuration variables.
    # 5) to stop the resolvconf package from controlling dnsmasq's
    #    idea of which upstream nameservers to use.

    # NB. If systemd is installed and starting dnsmasq, this file is IGNORED.

    # For upgraders from very old versions, all the shell variables set
    # here in previous versions are still honored by the init script
    # so if you just keep your old version of this file nothing will break.
